Array is a data structure that we use to represent a list if items

```javascript
let selectColours=['red','blue'];
//adding in array js is a dynamic language so the size of array changes at the run time

//object and the size of an array is dynamic

selectedColours[2]='green'

console.log(selectColours[0])
```
